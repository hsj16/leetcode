Two Sum
```
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

```
Example:

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

1. 没有说是有序
2. 没有规定存储空间

1. O(n^2) bruteforce 暴力法
2. O(1) 可以使用map来存储
